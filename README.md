# BlockDestroyer
Old plugin I made but open-sourcing it so you can have a look. I've left the Eclipse files in there (I started off with Eclipse \[and named it HelloPlugin] but changed to IntelliJ however I think I've removed all those files).
Feel free to use this plugin but please credit this repository if using this code in another project. If you have any edits, make a pull request.
To be honest I'm not really sure what to upload or not to this repo (this is my first *actual code* repo)
