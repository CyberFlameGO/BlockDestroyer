# KPM (KitPvP Mechanics) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/CyberFlameGO/KPM.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/CyberFlameGO/KPM)

KPM is a core which adds mechanics to the game for KitPVP on OuterWorlds. There are a lot of things this plugin doesn't
account for, which I'm aware of, and a lot of the plugin is hard-coded and not configurable.
